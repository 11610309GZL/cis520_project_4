---- PRELIMINARIES ----

>> If you have any preliminary comments on your submission, notes for the
>> TAs, or extra credit, please give them here.

>> Please cite any offline or online sources you consulted while
>> preparing your submission, other than the Pintos documentation, course
>> text, lecture notes, and course staff.

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

None

>> A2: What is the maximum size of a file supported by the inode
>> structure?  Show your work.

inode_disk in inode create must be equal to BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE to pass assertions.
BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE is defined as 512 bytes. We have 125 sectors possible, 
so 512 * 125 = 64,000 bytes

---- DIRECTORIES and SUBDIRECTORIES ----

>> A3: How do you prevent races on directory entries?  For example,
>> only one of two simultaneous attempts to remove a single file
>> should succeed, as should only one of two simultaneous attempts to
>> create a file with the same name, and so on.

>> A4: Does your implementation allow a directory to be removed if it
>> is open by a process or if it is in use as a process's current
>> working directory?  If so, what happens to that process's future
>> file system operations?  If not, how do you prevent it?
